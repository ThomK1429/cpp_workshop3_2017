0. A c++ program is a collection of functions. 


1.  Where have you seen a function in c++?

	main() 

	- what does the main function look like?

	-       int main() { 
		
		    your pgm statements go here

		
		    return 0;	
		}

2.  What is unusual about the  main() function?

	it is executed first, no matter where it is found in the c++ program. 

3. What is a function?

	functions are often called modules. 

	functions are like miniature programs. 

	functions are like building blocks, allowing you to divide a large or
	complicated c++ program into smaller more manageable pieces. 

	a segment that groups code  to perform a specific task.
		a function that will add 2 numbers, any 2 numbers, 
		a function that will convert a Fahrenheit temperature into a Centigrade Temperature
		a function that will convert a Centigrade Temperature into a Fahrenheit temperature
	
	you can take many functions and combine them to form a larger program. 

4. Functions are seen in college algebra. 

	f(x) = 2x + 5,     
		where f(1) = 2(1) + 5 = 7
		where f(2) = 2(2) + 5 = 9
		where f(3) = 2(3) + 5 = 11

	the 1,2,3 are the arguments of the function f, and 7, 9, 11 are the  
	corresponding values (the result) of f.  There is 1 argument, x. 


	f(x,y) = 2x + 3y,
		where f(1,2) = 2(1) + 3(2) = 8
		where f(3,4) = 2(3) + 3(4) = 18

	There are 2 arguments, x and y.
